## Introduction ##

The plugin allows to insert a horizontal in-line space in a text block. <strike>It was created mainly to provide some means to control width of DokuWiki table columns. This is more of a work-around rather than a solution, yet it has a more DokuWiki-sh feel than a <a href='http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:exttab1'>full-fledged rework of the table syntax</a>.</strike> _(To control width of a table use [Table Width plugin](TableWidth.md) instead.)_


## Syntax ##

The width of the spacer can be specified in any CSS units:

```
 <spacer 2em>
```


## Installation ##

You can use [Plugin Manager](http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:plugin) to install the [current release](http://dwp-forge.googlecode.com/files/spacer-2008-08-20.zip) or download it manually and unpack to plugins directory.

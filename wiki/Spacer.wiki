#summary Spacer plugin description.

== Introduction ==

The plugin allows to insert a horizontal in-line space in a text block. <strike>It was created mainly to provide some means to control width of DokuWiki table columns. This is more of a work-around rather than a solution, yet it has a more DokuWiki-sh feel than a [http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:exttab1 full-fledged rework of the table syntax].</strike> _(To control width of a table use [TableWidth Table Width plugin] instead.)_


== Syntax ==

The width of the spacer can be specified in any CSS units:

{{{
 <spacer 2em>
}}}


== Installation ==

You can use [http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:plugin Plugin Manager] to install the [http://dwp-forge.googlecode.com/files/spacer-2008-08-20.zip current release] or download it manually and unpack to plugins directory.

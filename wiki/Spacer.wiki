#summary Spacer plugin description.

== Introduction ==

The plugin allows to insert a horizontal in-line space in a text block. It was created mainly to provide some means to control width of DokuWiki table columns. This is more of a work-around rather than a solution, yet it has a more DokuWiki-sh feel than a [http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:exttab1 full-fledged rework of the table syntax].


== Syntax ==

The width of the spacer can be specified in any CSS units:

{{{
 <spacer 2em>
}}}

The intended use in a table context:

{{{
 ^ Title <spacer 20em>  ^  <spacer 5em> Centered <spacer 5em>  ^
 | Some title           |  Some value                          |
}}}


== Installation ==

You can use [http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:plugin Plugin Manager] to install the [http://dwp-forge.googlecode.com/files/spacer-2008-08-20.zip current release] or download it manually and unpack to plugins directory.
